# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README is the entry point for OctoAcme's project management processes and artifacts. It helps team members discover, explore, and apply standardized project workflows, roles, communication strategies, and quality assurance practices documented across this repository.

OctoAcme runs projects through an iterative lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Projects start with a lightweight Project One-pager that captures problem statement, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and high-level milestones. Planning turns approved work into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates, and a release/milestone map. Execution is managed via a project board workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a Pull Request process that favors small changes, CI validation, and at least one reviewer approval.

Roles are explicit: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria; and Stakeholders provide input and approvals. Communication cadence includes daily standups for the delivery team, weekly PM/PdM syncs, regular demos at the end of sprints or milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a Risk Register and escalated through defined paths when needed.

Quality assurance and release discipline are enforced with unit, integration, and smoke tests, CI-based linting and security scans, manual QA as required, and a formal release checklist (including rollback plans and post-deploy verification). Retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents produce prioritized action items that are tracked back into the backlog to drive continuous improvement.
